      <h1>Gacha Life</h1>
      <h3>Автор Анна Гудкова</h3>
      <p>A gacha game is a video game that implements the gacha (toy vending machine) mechanic. Similar to loot boxes, gacha games induce players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. The in-game currency can be gained by game play, or by purchasing it from the game publisher using real-world funds. Most of these games are free-to-play (F2P) mobile games, where the gacha serves as an incentive to spend real-world money</p>
      <p>In these games, there are usually numerous characters, cards, or other items that players can obtain, and most of them are only obtainable via a "gacha" mechanism.This allow players to "pull" or "spin" the gacha (analogous to a slot machine or roulette wheel) using a specific amount of in-game currency, which will then give the player a randomized character, card, or other item.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, these gacha are limited, such that specific prizes can only be obtained within a specific event time-frame.[3] Because some of the rewards have a lower chance to appear, typically players must spin the gacha many times before they get their desired outcome.[3] Other gacha models use a pity system: that is, if after a certain number of pulls the player does not receive an item, then the following pull will be guaranteed that item. Soft pity increases the probability slightly of getting a rare item with every pull, counting up and recalculating the probability until the rare item is received, while hard pity uses a counter to keep track of the number of pulls and automatically dispense the rare item after reaching a preset number.</p>

      <p>In May 2012, an article was published in a conservative Japanese newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, that criticized social networking games and specifically gacha for exploiting the naivety of children to make a profit. The main complaint of the article was that the gacha model too closely resembled gambling. The paper called for an investigation by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency to prevent abuse of the system</p>
      <p> Several cases of teenagers and even younger kids spending equivalents of over 1000 USD have been reported in the media. Shortly after, the suggested investigation was performed and the model of complete gacha was declared illegal by the Consumer Affairs Agency, citing the Law for Preventing Unjustifiable Extras or Unexpected Benefit and Misleading Representation</p>
      <p> The Consumer Affairs Agency stated that virtual items could be considered "prizes" under existing legislation written in 1977 to prevent the complete gacha practice in the context of baseball trading cards. Within a month of the statement being issued, all major Japanese game publishers had removed complete gacha rules from their games, though many developers found ways around this</p>
      <p>In addition, several lawsuits were launched in Japan against companies selling gacha products, leading to temporary decrease in their stock market value by almost a quarter</p>
